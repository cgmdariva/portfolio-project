# portfolio-project
My portfolio using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and Flask (Python).
 
This portfolio was inspired by the classes of professor Thiago Lima (ThiCode) on his youtube channel. Few things have been modified by me. I decided to go back with it to recall concepts of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Flask. I hope you enjoy!
